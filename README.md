# cellular-automata

Cellular automation is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory. It consists of a regular grid of cells, each with 
a finite number of states, and the grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. Check out this [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) for more information about it.

I've created 3 simulations as a start:
0. Conway's Game Of Life

1. War-Tor 
2. Forest Fire 

These simulations can be toggled by changing the integer in App.java respectively here \
`CAController ca = new CAController(0);`
